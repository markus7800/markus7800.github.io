		<h1>Autoencoding MNIST</h1>
		<main>
			<p>
				This work was inspired by <a href="https://n8python.github.io/mnistLatentSpace/">n8python</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction.
			</p>
			<p>
				The MNIST data set contains 28x28 gray scale images of digits and is thus 784 dimensional data.
				However, the most important features of digits can be captured with much less dimensions.
			</p>
			<p>
				An artificial neural network for autoencoding typically squeezes the data to lower and lower dimension before expanding it again to its original shape.
				The loss is then the squared difference of the input to the output,
				\begin{align}
					L(\mathbf{x}) = ||y_\mathbf{w}(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{x}||_2^2.
				\end{align}

				After training the neural network it can be split into two parts:<br>

				- Encoder: the part that reduces the dimension<br>

				- Decoder: the part that expands the dimension<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Below you can see the architecture comprised of fully connected layers used for autoencoding MNIST.
				All activations are \(\text{tanh}\) except for the output of the encoder and decoder where the activation was chosen to be \(\text{sigmoid}\) such that the values are in \([0,1].\)

			<p>
				Now we can encode all images with two values in \([0,1].\) This two dimensional space is called latent space.
				Since the neural network is continuous, moving in latent space and decoding to image space results in two dimensional continuous transformations of one digit into another.

			<p>
				It is interesting to see that similarly shaped numbers are close together in the latent space.
				For example, 3 is close to 8 and 4 is close to 9. For both we just need to "close or open the loops" to get from one to the other. Also 1 and 7 are neighbours as they are basically just one line.
				We can also see that the numbers are a little bit fuzzy compared to the original data set. This is because the 784 dimensional image space cannot be reduced to two dimensions without some loss of information.
