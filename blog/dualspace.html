		<h2>Dual Spaces and Discontinuous Linear Functionals</h2>
		<main>
			<h3>Are there even discontinuous linear functionals?</h3>
			<p>
				For me it was hard to think of an example of a discontinuous linear function.
				Certainly in the finite dimensional case all linear functions are continuous, because they are - in a sense - simply matrix multiplications.
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, we have to think big - infinite dimensional big.
				Consider all bounded infinitely differentiable functions on \(\R\) equipped with the supremums norm \(\norm{.}_\infty\).
				Define the sequence
				\[f_n = x \mapsto \frac{1}{n}\sin(n x).\]
				It is easy to see that \(\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n = 0\).
			</p>
			<p>
				But for the derivatives \(f_n' = x \mapsto \cos(n x)\) the limit does not exist. Therefore, the linear operator \(\frac{d}{dx}\) is not continuous.
			</p>

			<h3>How can we characterise continuous linear functions?</h3>
			<p>
				To be able to speak of continuity we at least need a topology.
			</p>
			<p>
				A real (complex) vector space \(X\) with Hausdorff topology \(\T\) is said to be a topological vector space if addition and scalar multiplication is continuous with respect to \(\T\).
			</p>
			<p>
				The dual space \(X'\) is the set of all continuous linear functions \(f:X \to \C\). It is a subspace of all functionals \(X^*\).
			</p>

			<p>
				Just like all functionals on \(\R^n\) are continuous in the case of finite dimensional topological vector spaces this also holds.
			</p>
			<h3>Theorem.</h3>
			<p>
				Let \(\left< X, \T \right>\) be a \(n\) dimensional topological vector space then \(X' = X^*\).
			</p>

			<p style="font-style: italic">Proof.</p>
			<p>
				Consider the normed space \(\left<\C^n, \norm{.}_2 \right>\).
				Let \(\{e_i : i=1,\dots,n\}\) be the standard basis of \(\C^n\) and let \(f \in \C^{n*}\). We have
				\[|f(z)| = |f(\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i e_i)| = \sum_{i=1}^n |\alpha_i ||f(e_i)|\le C \norm{z}_2.\]
				Therefore, \({\C^{n}}' = \C^{n*}.\)
			</p>
			<p>
				Now it is sufficient to show that \(X\) is homeomorphic to \(\C^{n}\).
			</p>
			<p>
				Let \(\psi: \C^n \to X\) be an isomorphism.
				Again
				\[\psi(z) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \psi(e_i).\]
				As \(|\alpha_i| \le \norm{z}_2\) the coefficients depend continuously on \(z\). As addition and scalar multplication on \(X\) are continuous \(\psi\) is continuous.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now we have to show that \(\psi^{-1}\) is continuous. As it is linear it is enough to show continuity at \(0\).
			</p>
			<p>
				Let \(S^{n-1} = \{z \in \C^n : \norm{z}_2 = 1 \}\) which is compact. Thus \(K:= \psi(S^{n-1}) \subseteq X\) is also compact and since T2 closed. As \(\operatorname{ker}(\psi) = \) we have \(0 \in X \setminus K\). Choose a circled open neigbourhood of \(0\), \(V \subseteq X \setminus K\).
			</p>
			<p> 
				Let
				\(E := \psi^{-1}(V)\).
				This set is circled and
				\[E \cap S^{n-1} = \psi^{-1}(V \cap K) = \emptyset.\]
				Thus \(E \subseteq U_1^{\C^n}(0)\).
			</p>
			<p>
				Let \(\epsilon > 0\).
				\[\psi^{-1}(\epsilon V) = \epsilon \psi^{-1}(V) = \epsilon E \subseteq U_\epsilon^{\C^n}(0)\]
				which proves continuity at \(0\).
			</p>
			<p align="right">\(\Box\)</p>

			<p>
				In the introduction we found an example for a discontinuous function in an infinite dimensional vector space. Interestingly enough, this is always possible.
			</p>
			<h3>Proposition.</h3>
			<p>
				Let \(\left< X, \norm{.} \right>\) be a infinite dimensional normed vector space then \(X^* \setminus X' \neq \emptyset\).
			</p>
			<p style="font-style: italic">Proof.</p>
			
			<p>
				Let \(\{b_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}\) be a linearly independent set. 
			</p>

			<p>
				By the theorem of linear continuation let \(f\) be the linear function with
				\[f(b_n) = n \cdot \norm{b_n}.\]
				This map is unbounded and thus discontinuous.
			</p>

			<p align="right">\(\Box\)</p>

			<p>
				Note that for any vector space \(X\) we can find a topology such that all functionals are continuous. In particular let \(\T = \sigma(X,X^*)\) be the weak topology with respect to \(X^*\).
				Then \(\left< X, \T \right>\) is a locally convex topological vector space where every functional is continuous.
			</p>

			<p>
				There even exist a topological vector space where there is no continuous functional.
			</p>
			<h3>Proposition.</h3>
			<p>
				Let \(p \in (0,1) \) and let
				\[\Delta f = \int_{(0,1)} |f(t)|^p d\lambda(t).\]
				Then \(L^p(0,1) = \{f:(0,1)\to \C : \Delta f < \infty\}\) is a vector space with metric
				\[d(f,g) = \Delta(g-f).\]
				It holds that \({L^p(0,1)}' = \{0\}\).
			</p>
			<p style="font-style: italic">Proof.</p>
			<h3>Claim.</h3>
			<p>
				If a \(V\), a neighbourhood of \(0\), is convex, then \(V = L^p(0,1)\).
			</p>
			<p style="font-style: italic">Proof.</p>
			<p>
				Let \(f\in L^p(0,1)\) and \(U_r^\Delta(0) \subseteq V\).
				Choose \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(n^{p-1} \Delta f < r\).
			</p>
			<p>
				The measure
				\[\mu(A) = \int_A |f(t)|^p d\lambda(t)\]
				is finite and thus
				\[x \mapsto \mu((0,x))\]
				is continuous. Therefore, we can choose \(x_j\) such that \(\mu(0,x_j) = \frac{j}{n}\Delta f\).
			</p>
			<p>
				Define
				\(g_i = n f I_{(x_{i-1}, x_j]}\).
				It holds that \(f = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n g_i\) and
				\[\Delta g_i = \int_{(x_{i-1}, x_j]} |nf(t)|^p d\lambda(t) = n^{p-1} \Delta f < r.\]
				Thus \(g_i \in V\) and as a convex combination \(f \in V\).
			</p>

			<p align="right">\(\Box\)</p>

			<p>
				Suppose there is a \(\psi \in L^p(0,1)'\) such that there is a \(f \in L^p(0,1)\) with
				\(\psi(f) = c \neq 0\).
			</p>
			<p>
				Choose \(\epsilon = \frac{|c|}{2}\). Now for any \(\delta > 0 \) it holds that 
				\[\psi(U_\delta^\Delta(0)) = \psi(L^p(0,1)) \ni c.\]
				So we have
				\[\psi(U_\delta^\Delta(0)) \not\subseteq U_\epsilon^\Delta(0)\]
				which makes \(\psi\) discontinuous.
